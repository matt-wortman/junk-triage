# Preferred Upgrade Strategy

- Default to the **newest stable release** of each runtime and dependency unless a blocking issue is documented.
- For Node.js, target the **latest LTS that is currently active** (upgrade immediately when a newer LTS becomes available).
- When evaluating library upgrades, prefer the most recent version published on npm and record any exceptions (with justification) in upgrade notes.
- Revisit this rule during each upgrade cycle to ensure the project stays on current, supported software.
