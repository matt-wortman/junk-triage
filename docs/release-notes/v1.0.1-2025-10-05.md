# Release Notes — v1.0.1 (2025-10-05)

## Summary
- Enabled page-to-page navigation without blocking on required fields while keeping submission validation intact.
- Cleared outstanding ESLint issues so CI linting can run clean.
- Rebuilt and redeployed the container image to Azure with digest `sha256:eb61a04a80a1cc7c7c8b17030c0d2d3e09860156b4763af2bb2fa05c308864ac` (ACR run `caa`).
- Hardened basic authentication so missing credentials fail closed instead of allowing anonymous access.

## UX Changes
- **Section Skipping:** Form navigation no longer checks required questions before advancing. Users can freely move between sections and only need to resolve validation errors when submitting. (`DynamicFormNavigation.tsx`)

## Developer Experience
- **Lint Hygiene:** Addressed unused variables, environment flag mismatches, and unescaped entities so `npm run lint` completes without warnings.

## Security
- **Fail-Closed Basic Auth:** The Next.js middleware now returns HTTP 500 if either `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` or `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is unset, preventing the app from running without credentials. (`middleware.ts`)

## Deployment Notes
- `az acr build --registry innovationventures --image tech-triage-platform:prod .`
- `az webapp restart -g rg-eastus-hydroxyureadosing -n tech-triage-app`
- Health verification: `curl -s https://tech-triage-app.azurewebsites.net/api/health`

> **Open Items:** Key Vault RBAC work remains outstanding; continue exporting secrets manually before running `scripts/deploy-to-azure.sh`.
