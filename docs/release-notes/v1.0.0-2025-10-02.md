# Release Notes — 2025-10-02

## Summary
- Added a production-ready PDF export pipeline for the dynamic form system.
- Refined the export document to read like a polished report, including scoring tables and impact vs value charting.
- Adjusted the builder landing page to render dynamically so container builds no longer require a live DATABASE_URL.
- Re-built and pushed the `tech-triage-platform:prod` image (`sha256:31bcaa541b70261694fe806ff8cd8a4490743adbe9ebcbf4f40dc3a5eef99ff7`) and restarted the Azure Web App.

## New Features
- **PDF Export Endpoint (`POST /api/form-exports`)**: accepts live form state or a stored submission and returns a fully formatted PDF.
  - Handles blank, draft, and submitted modes.
  - Normalizes option labels and repeatable group content.
  - Automatically infers Technology ID when not supplied.
- **Report Layout Enhancements**: numbered questions, muted guidance removal, and analytics section split onto its own page.
- **Scoring Visuals**: export now mirrors the UI scoring matrix and impact vs value quadrant, including recommendation pill styling.

## Architecture Updates
- `/dynamic-form/builder` exports `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to avoid static pre-rendering during Docker builds.
- Info-box questions are filtered out of report generation to prevent empty responses in exports.

## Deployment Notes
