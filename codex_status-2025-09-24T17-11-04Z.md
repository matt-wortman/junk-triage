### Recent Work
- Confirmed demo data pipeline after latest refactors; `scripts/verify-demo-data.ts` reports correct option values, numeric scores, and repeatable group JSON.
- Tidied Docker startup flow so `scripts/start.sh` respects `SEED_DEMO_DATA` and logs whether demo submissions seed.
- Revalidated Jest configuration (`jest.config.mjs`) and database seeding tests; duplication-free Prisma client usage now under dependency injection.

### Current Health
- `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, and `npm test -- demo-seeding` all pass locally.
- `SEED_DEMO_DATA` toggles cleanly across local, Docker, and CI usage.
- Demo submissions align with runtime requirements (no string coercion, canonical option values, single Prisma client instance).

### Active Focus / Next Steps
1. Continue Phase 4 roadmap: expand question set, implement repeatable group CRUD UI, and wire full submission persistence.
2. Extend validation layer (Zod) to cover multi-step workflows and repeatable groups prior to authentication work.
3. Prepare for auth hardening by documenting API boundaries and data-access patterns (see `NEXT_STEPS.md`).
