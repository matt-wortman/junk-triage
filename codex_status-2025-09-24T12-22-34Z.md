### Recent Work
- Rebuilt Prisma seed pipeline with type-safe helpers and demo submissions using canonical option values and preserved JSON types.
- Added configurable demo data toggle across Docker/start scripts, plus CLI scripts for synthetic data and verification.
- Refactored demo seeding tests with dependency-injected Prisma client and comprehensive assertions; lint/type-check suite is clean.
- Verified full workflow via `SEED_DEMO_DATA=true npx prisma db seed` and `npx tsx scripts/verify-demo-data.ts` (4 submissions, 3 submitted + 1 draft).

### Current Health
- `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, and `npm test -- demo-seeding` all pass.
- Demo data in the database now mirrors runtime expectations (option values, numeric scores, repeatable groups).
- Outstanding feature work remains per Phase 4 roadmap: expanded question set, repeatable group UI, persistence enhancements, comprehensive validation.

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Implement the enhanced question structure (60+ questions) and repeatable group UI per `NEXT_STEPS.md`.
2. Wire dynamic form persistence (draft autosave, resume) and extend Zod validation coverage.
3. Evaluate authentication approach before exposing submission APIs beyond demo mode.
